    <h2>Background</h2>
    <h3>First Steps (7-9 years old)</h3>
    <p>I started coding at 7 years old at school with a program called "Scratch" made my by MIT as a way to get kids into coding. I made many very simple games, and I really enjoyed it. So for my 9th birthday my parents got me a my first computer. I started using it to code games at home and it is this is the reason I was able to code for the web.</p>
    <h3>Early Ages (10-11 years old)</h3>
    <p>Since my dad was a web developer, I naturally was intrested in web development as well, he taught me some basics of Laravel (a PHP framework) but it was a little much for me, so I tried again in a few months, this time with HTML and CSS. I was able to create a few basic web pages. But most of my coding during this time was at a place called Code Ningas, where I would learn some javascript, Roblox game design, and some Unity Game Design.</p>
    <h3>#LearnToCode (12 years old)</h3>
    <p>During December of 2023 I started writing some HTML and CSS on w3schools.com with my friend, but in January I switched to using FreeCodeCamp and I started putting all my code onto Github. I ended up completing the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/Alexofthek/responsive-web-design">FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Course</a>. I also finished the Odin Project web development basics and Intermediate CSS course. I ended up making a lot of projects on the way which are all on my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/alexkozlovm">Github</a></p>
    <h3>More Javascript (13 years old)</h3>
    <p>Now I am defenitly still learning but I am not actively doing courses or watching tutorials. During this time I have experimented with many types of coding such as Roblox, Godot, Unity, and more. But I have finally setteled on learning more javascript. I have completing projects like this one, as well as teaching one of my friends to code in javascript.</p>
