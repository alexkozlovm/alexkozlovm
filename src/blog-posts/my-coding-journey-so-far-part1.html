        <p>It has been a little over a month since I resumed my efforts to learn to code, I started around December 30,
            and
            I have been coding ever since. I am here to share everything I’ve learned so far.</p>
        <h2>Timeline of What and How I Have Learned</h2>
        <p>At first, I started as most people do, watching videos on YouTube. Some of the tutorials that I watched were
            from
            creators like Tech with Tim, Javascript Mastery, and Fireship, But I didn’t learn much except the very
            basics of
            Python and JavaScript. Therefore I wanted a more structured way to learn, and I found a free resource called
            Freecodecamp i spent almost an entire month just doing their responsive web design course. It was overall
            pretty
            great, and it was very easy to get started compared to watching YouTube videos where you would have to set
            up
            the development environment yourself. About 1/4 through the courses I was getting a little bored so I tried
            Codecademy I got a free trial of their pro membership and I took a course on command line basics, which was
            very
            random but has been helping me set up my development environment for the Odin Project. After that, I was
            back at
            Freecodecamp and on January 20 I finished the course. For the past few days, I have started 2 new courses,
            CS50x
            and the Odin Project. I’m not sure which one I like more and will commit to, but I think it is the Odin
            Project
            because the long lectures in CS50x are just so long, compared to the fairly quick reading that you do when
            taking the Odin Project.</p>
        <h2>Coding Resources</h2>
        <p>In this section, I will rate each one of the coding resources I have used so far on a scale of 1–10.</p>
        <h3>Youtube</h3>
        <p>YouTube was the first way I and many other people started to learn to code. Overall youtube is mostly bad
            because
            of the risk of you falling into TUTORIAL HELL. If you haven’t heard of tutorial hell it is a state where you
            constantly watch tutorials, but you don’t apply what you have learned, this causes you to think you know a
            lot
            more than you do, and it causes you to barely remember anything. Other than that the tutorials I watched on
            YouTube were ok they were not anything great. So overall I would rate YouTube a 4.5/10.</p>
        <h3>Freecodecamp</h3>
        <p>Freecodecamp was very good, It is the most beginner-friendly course out of any of these, and requires almost
            no
            setup and it is 100% free. The courses are pretty easy but they do get harder. It also makes you create your
            projects which helps you apply your learning, and build your portfolio. However I did recently take their
            Javascript course, but I did not enjoy it as it is still in Beta and has bugs. However, this may change in
            the
            future. Overall I would rate Freecodecamp an 8/10.</p>
        <h3>Codecademy</h3>
        <p>Codecademy was pretty good, I barely did it so I do not have much experience with it however I do like the
            way
            the courses are structured, but I do not like how so many are paid. The best thing about Codecademy is the
            wide
            range of courses it has, it is best if you want to learn something more niche because it just has so many
            courses. The courses themselves aren’t amazing but they aren’t bad either. I just feel that 30–40$ a month
            is
            overpriced and you can find great tutorials on YouTube if you are learning something niche. Overall I would
            rate
            Codecademy a 6/10.</p>
        <h3>CS50x</h3>
        <p>CS50x is the course I have the least experience with. However, I can still see the downfalls and upsides to
            it.
            CS50 or CS50x is great for complete beginners to programming. However, it does require more math knowledge
            and
            more general knowledge as the course is given at Harvard. The long lectures can get boring if you do not
            have a
            very long attention span, so this made me constantly want to take breaks. However, there are so many people
            to
            ask for and the community is just great. So overall I would rate CS50x a 7/10.</p>
        <h3>The Odin Project</h3>
        <p>The Odin Project is a free and open-source course on full-stack web development. It does not have many
            options
            regarding what coding language you want to learn (either Ruby with Rails or Javascript with Node) But I
            would
            say this is a good thing as it prevents you from learning a bunch of different programming languages that
            you do
            not need to know. It also has a great community, however, it may be a little harder for beginners as it
            moves a
            bit faster than other courses and expects you to do a little of your research. Overall I would rate The Odin
            Project 8.5/10.</p>
